# UpgradedDefectMod
Custom cards for the Defect from Slay the Spire

This mod introduces a bunch of new cards for the Defect, removes the same number of cards and makes some changes on existing cards, eventually it will be a whole new character !!!

At the moment a lot of the cards are broken power wise but i want to more content before figuring out exactly how to balance it all with testing. I'm not giving a precise direction to the defect (yet?), so feel free to try the mod and let me know what you think is good/bad/why about the changes, and what you'd like to see implemented.

Currently features 31 cards and 3 relics
